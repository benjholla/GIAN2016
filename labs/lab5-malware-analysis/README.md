# Malware Analysis Lab

This lab allows the student to practice program comprehension of large software in order to explore and discover potential malice embedded in a large Android application (ConnectBotBad). Additionally the student may practice their program comprehension skills by reverse engineering a binary Android malware sample (FlashBang). Both samples have been custom created for this lab. It is not advisable to install either sample to personal devices!

If malware is discovered the malware discovery form should be completed, otherwise an absence of malware form should be completed.

The password to decrypt each malware sample is "infected".

Solutions to both exercises can be found in the "solutions" folder.
